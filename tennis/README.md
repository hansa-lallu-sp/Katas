Focus only on a single game
In one game you may score: 0 (love), 15, 30 and 40 points
You win a game if you:
have 40 points
win the next ball
have an advantage of 2 points
If both players have 40 points then there is a 'deuce'
Deuce: in order to be a winner you should score two points twice in succession. Otherwise, the deuce still lasts
Result: current score or who wins

Steps:

1. simplest thing first is to have a game that has a score of "Love - Love"

2. increase player ones score by 15 only
"Fifteen - Love"

3. increases player ones score by 15 again
"Thirty - Love"

4. increases player ones score by 10
"Forty - Love"

5. player one wins game after 40 points
